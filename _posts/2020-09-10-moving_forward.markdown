The Flatiron school challenged me, frustrated me, made me want to quit, but I held through to the end. I don't have words to express how happy I am!

Now that I've completed the program, I wanted to share some of the hard taught lessons that I've learned:

- Understand your tools is crucial! Taking the time early on to learn how to debug basic apps can save countless hours of debugging later. 
- Programming can really try your patience if you're not careful. Learn how to be patient and think through problems and structures. 
- Learning to read documentation doesn't have to be scary! It gets so much easier the more you do it!
- Take in information from all (good) sources you can find. Everybody understands things differently and it's better to use a wide funnel for the info.
- Your hard work will be rewarded! Keep pushing.

Yes, I learned a ton of other stuff too, (you know, building websites and stuff). But beyond the syntax and language specific details, I learned that I can still grown and better myself. I still have more to accomplish and I yearn to learn!

Now that I've finished my flatiron program, I plan to practice programming every day. I'd like to get as good as I can be. I intend to find a job as a full stack developer. I can't wait!d me, made me want to quit, but i held through to the end. I don't have words to express how happy I am!
