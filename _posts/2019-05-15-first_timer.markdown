I'll be the first to admit, I'm a rookie when it comes to programming. I understand (for the most part) the major concepts and ideas of Object Oriented Programming but I'm pretty frequently spending hours ironing out the small details. I'd like to think that I'm a quick learner and can overcome most problems with a bit of patience and some time to think. I found out that I was right! but OH, BOY was I tested with the Ruby CLI Gem project. In all my years of schooling, I don't think I've ever been faced with such a challenge. "What do I do?", "Where do I begin?", "Who am I??". So many questions in such a short time. After the initial shock, I sat down, had a drink, and collected my nerves. "I can do this"

It absolutely was not an easy task, but the feeling of accomplishment at the end was unbelievable. My project isn't going to change the world; it's a simple program that displays details about cool places to hang out in Southern California. But it completely changed me. This is my FIRST real project! It wiped so many doubts from my mind and reaffirmed that I CAN do this. I can't believe that I'm saying it, but now I'm looking forward to the next project!
