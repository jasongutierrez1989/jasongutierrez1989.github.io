I'm sure that I don't need to explain the state of the world right now to anyone reading, but 2020 has been a rough year. Unfortunately there isn't an easy way through these difficult times, we just have to get up everyday and make it go through it. Sometimes  however, we can get lucky enough to find ways to make it a little easier. 

This quarantine has given me so much time to reflect on myself. Not being out in the world really has given me the opportunity to look inward, to address my insecurites, to understand my motivations and well being better. It hasn't been easy, but it's something I think a lot of us don't give ourselves the time to do, and somthing I know I've been avoiding for years.

I've learned a lot, and I feel like I'm seeing more positive changes every day. This javascript project landed on me while I was in a rough patch. I didn't know if I would ever finish, and frankly I was lacking the motivation to make it through. But as I've been growing and understanding what drives me, I decided not to give up. It was slow at first, but I set a schedule to knock out the rest of it and I did it! The best part is that I remembered why I love coding. I love it BECAUSE it can be hard. The satisfaction of figuring it out that bug, or seeing the project come to life as you keep creating is incredible!

It's these small victories that sometimes make the world feel a little less cold. I apologize if this comes accross to anyone as insensitive, I am wholly aware that people are truly suffering right now. I just wanted to share what has helped me. Now, it's on to the finish line! I can't wait
