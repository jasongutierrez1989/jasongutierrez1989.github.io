It's hard to believe how much I've learned in a (relatively) short amount of time. To think, just a couple of months ago, I wouldn't have had any idea that I could do this project. The amount of complexity here is intimidating to say the least. Yet i feel like I've barely scratched the surface of what is possible! Seeing the cohort leads use different techniques, looking at projects that my fellow cohorts have made, it's so inspiring.

This Sinatra project was not easy, by any stretch of imagination. It took me far longer than I had anticipated and challenged my understanding of the material to the core. 

Having completed my project, I can confidently say that I AM IMPROVING. I know that there is still so much for me to learn and see, but every step had been incredible and I can't wait for the next challenge!
