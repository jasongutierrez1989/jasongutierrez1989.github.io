It all seems a bit crazy; to think that in about a year I could be working as a web developer. My career history has been a checkered one to say the least. From providing emergency medicine, to being a banking professional, I've covered a pretty wide spectrum of jobs. And yet, nothing ever seemed to be a good fit for me. I could never quite figure out why I'm so frequently compelled to move from profession to profession. That is, until the obvious presented itself. Why not do something that I love for a living? That's why I'm here. It's time to get serious about my career and it's time to do something that I actually have interest in. I've loved technology for as long as I can remember and frankly I couldn't be more excited about my future. Flatiron, let's do this!
