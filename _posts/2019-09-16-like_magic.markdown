I'll never forget the line that I read before learning about Rails. "It will feel like magic." I didn't really buy it, seemed way too good to be true. The thing is, Rails kinda is like magic! So many processes are streamlined in Rails and it really knocked my socks off. And then the magic wore off a bit. This new-found ability to create the skeleton of an app in a few seconds means that there are a lot of more important things to worry about. A LOT. The learning moved from the basics to focusing on more detail and it's not easy as a new programmer to get into. Now that I've played with it for a bit, I can confidently say, that I need more practice! Flatiron School has continuously challenged me to learn and get better, and after finishing my Rails Portfolio Project, I can see how much more I have to learn. The adventure continues!
