Well, this is it. This is what I have been working for. I finally made it to the last project! All of the blood (figurative), sweat, and tears (not-so-figurative) have brought me here. I couldn't be more excited to start my adventure in software engineering!

My final project was a bit overwhelming. I had high ambitions and was quickly humbled by React syntax and stores and states and so on. This was tough. I couldn't get Redux Dev Tools to work and felt like I was in way over my head. Fortunately, my (limited) experience in development was there to help. I found answers on forums, through documentation. I followed Redux tutorials and watched countless videos trying to understand. I definitely don't have all of the knowledge yet, but now I feel so much more confident!

I think my biggest takeaway from this project vs the others that I've done through Flatiron is that the learning HAS to continue. Every day. The more that I dedicate myself to learning how to program, the more that I love it! I'm coming for you world!
